# Find-The-Invisible-Cow
Someone told me it was impossible to make a game in R, so I did it.

How to run it:
1. Download it.
2. Open it in R Studio.
3. Install any dependencies required.
4. Run "Find the Invisible Cow.R".

How to play:
- Click anywhere in the pop-up window to try find the cow.
- The loudness of the cow's moos increases the closer you get to the cow.
- Once you click close enough to the cow, it will reveal itself.
- If you're finding it difficult, your distance to the cow is printed out in the console.
